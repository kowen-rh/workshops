[id="{prefix}"]
= Git: Avoiding merge conflicts

[id="{prefix}-essential-workflow"]
== Essential workflow

. Clone your fork of the upstream repository you will be contributing to:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ git clone __<address-of-your-fork>__
----

. Change your working directory to the generated local copy.

. Create a remote for the upstream of your fork:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ git remote add upstream __<address-of-upstream-repository>__
----

. Pull any upstream changes and rebase based on upstream's `master` branch:
+
----
$ git pull --rebase upstream master
----
+
[NOTE]
====
* This command will pull all of the upstream changes, apply them, then replay your local commits back on top of the updated branch contents.
* You should run `git pull --rebase upstream master` any time changes are committed to the upstream repository.
Ensuring that you are using the latest upstream `master` branch will prevent issues which occur due to using an old version of the `master` branch.
====

. Create your topic branch based on the latest upstream `master`:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ git checkout -b __<topic-branch>__
----
+
[NOTE]
====
When creating a new branch, the branch will be based on the content of the _current_ branch.
Ensure that you are on the `master` branch and have any recent upstream changes pulled and rebased before creating your topic branch.
This will prevent issues and merge conflicts which occur due to using an old version of the `master` branch.
====

. Make small, atomic changes to the content for your topic branch.
Only commit the changes once you are certain that your changes are complete:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "__<commit-message>__"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
* You may need to switch branches before your work is entirely ready to commit.
To do this cleanly, see <<{prefix}-using-the-stash>>.
* You should ensure that your changes are small and atomic so that your commit is as focused as possible.
A focused commit will only touch the information relevant to it.
A smaller affected surface means less opportunities for merge conflicts.
====

[id="{prefix}-pull-request-workflow"]
== Pull request workflow

. If changes are requested on your pull request, you can amend this commit and force-push the changes to your fork:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ git add --all
$ git commit --amend
$ git push --force origin __<topic-branch>__
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Amending the commit and force-pushing to your fork will update the pull request with your changes while ensuring you only add a single commit to the repository.
This helps keep the Git history clean while avoiding potential merge conflicts for others in the future.
====

[id="{prefix}-using-the-stash"]
== Using the stash

You may need to switch branches in your local repository before the changes you have made are ready to commit.
In this case, `git` will report an error when you attempt to switch branches due to the current status not being in a clean state.
The `git stash` command provides a way to ensure a clean Git state while preserving your in-progress changes.

[id="{prefix}-stashing-changes"]
=== Stashing changes

To preserve your in-progress edits while keeping the Git state clean, use the following command:

----
$ git stash
----

This command will stash your changes away and return Git to a clean state.
You can now safely switch to the required branch.

[id="{prefix}-restoring-stashed-changes"]
=== Restoring stashed changes

Once you are done with the work required on a different branch, checkout the branch you were previously working on and use the following command to restore your previous edits:

----
$ git stash pop
----

[id="{prefix}-listing-stashed-changes"]
=== Listing stashed changes

If you have more than one set of changes stashed, you can view the contents of your stash with the following command:

----
$ git stash list
----

[id="{prefix}-using-visual-tools"]
== Using visual tools

Git allows you to define visual tools for working with diffs and merges.
link:http://meldmerge.org/[Meld] is a recommended choice.

To install Meld on Fedora, use the following command:

----
$ sudo dnf install meld
----

[id="{prefix}-configuring-the-diff-tool"]
=== Configuring the diff tool

To configure Meld as your diff tool, add the following to your [filename]`~/.gitconfig` file:

----
[diff]
  tool = meld
[difftool]
  prompt = false
[difftool "meld"]
  cmd = meld "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE"
----

Use the configured visual diff tool with the following command:

----
$ git difftool
----

[NOTE]
====
The diff tool does not replace the functionality of the `git diff` command.
To use the configured visual diff tool, use the `git difftool` command.
====

[id="{prefix}-configuring-the-merge-tool"]
=== Configuring the merge tool

To configure Meld as your merge tool, add the following to your [filename]`~/.gitconfig` file:

----
[merge]
  tool = meld
[mergetool "meld"]
  cmd = meld "$LOCAL" "$MERGED" "$REMOTE" --output "$MERGED"
----

Use the configured visual merge tool with the following command:

----
$ git mergetool
----

[NOTE]
====
* The visual merge tool is _not_ used to *perform* merges.
Merges should be performed as usual using the `git merge` command.
* The visual merge tool applies once a merge conflict appears.
To resolve the merge conflict using the configured merge tool, use the `git mergetool` command.
====

[id="{prefix}-misc-advice"]
== Miscellaneous advice

. **Know who is working on what and when.**
** This is the primary social aspect of what causes the majority of the remaining merge conflicts you are likely to encounter.
By knowing who is working on a specific section at a specific time, you can ensure that no one else works on the same content while their work is in progress.
. Be vigilant about the status of the Git repository.
** Use `git status` often.
** Make sure that your Git repository is as up-to-date as possible with the upstream repository.
** Before beginning new work, checkout your `master` branch, pull and rebase from the upstream repository's `master` branch, _then_ create your topic branch.
. _(Optional)_ Use one line per sentence when writing in AsciiDoc.
** Using one line per sentence makes `git` logs and diffs cleaner.
This practice also ensures that no merge conflicts will occur if two separate sentences are changed within a single paragraph.
** AsciiDoc still renders sentences on individual lines as coherent paragraphs until two new lines are encountered in a row.
